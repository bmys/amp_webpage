             | The Border Collie is a working and herding dog breed developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding livestock, especially sheep. It was specifically bred for intelligence and obedience. Considered highly intelligent, and typically extremely energetic, acrobatic, smart and athletic, they frequently compete with great success in dog sports, in addition to their success in sheepdog trials. They are often cited as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs. Border Collies also remain employed throughout the world in their traditional work of herding livestock.
